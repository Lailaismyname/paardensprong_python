Paardensprong / Horsejump


Paardensprong is a dutch word game, the english translation would be Horse Jump. <br>
The name is derived from the move a horse would make on a chessboard.<br>
The rules are simple, you are provided with a table filled with letters and you need to find the word.<br>
The words are laid on the table by following a pattern that a horse on the chessboard would make.<br>
So the first letter gets placed randomly, and the second one by making a horsejump. And so on. Your goal is to guess the word!<br>
When you start the game, you are greeted by the game screen.<br>
There you will have 3 options to choose from.<br>
You can either start the game, which will start the game.<br>
Or you can press H for help, which will provide you with a explanation on how the game is supposed to be played.<br>
Or you can quit the game by pressing ctrl + D.<br>
Pressing Ctrl + D at any time will quit the game for you.<br>
If you start the game, and guess the word correctly you will receive a little horse and the next word to guess will be shown on screen.<br>
You can guess words to infinity and beyond, although there are only 1014 words in the text file.<br>
If you play long enough, you might run into a few of the same words<br>
