Project name:

Paardensprong / Horsejump


Paardensprong is a dutch word game, since it has no english equivalent i have decided to name it with the literal translation.
In this case that would be Horse Jump. The name is derived from the move a horse would make on a chessboard.
The rules are simple, you are provided with a table filled with letters and you need to find the word.
The words are laid on the table by following a pattern that a horse on the chessboard would make.
So the first letter gets placed randomly, and the second one by making a horsejump. And so on. Your goal is to guess the word!
When you start the game, you are greeted by the game screen.
There you will have 3 options to choose from.
You can either start the game, which will start the game.
Or you can press H for help, which will provide you with a explanation on how the game is supposed to be played.
Or you can quit the game by pressing ctrl + D.
Pressing Ctrl + D at any time will quit the game for you.
If you start the game, and guess the word correctly you will receive a little horse and the next word to guess will be shown on screen.
You can guess words to infinity and beyond, although there are only 1014 words in the text file.
If you play long enough, you might run into a few of the same words
